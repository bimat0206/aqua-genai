## [1.0] - 2025-06-19

### Added
- **uploadedReferenceImageKey field support** - Enhanced history data model to include reference image key
  - Added `UploadedReferenceImageKey` field to `VerificationRecord` struct
  - Added `UploadedReferenceImageKey` field to `HistoryItem` struct
  - Updated DynamoDB attribute mapping to handle the new field
  - Enhanced data processing to include reference image information in responses

### Changed
- **API Response Structure** - History responses now include reference image key when available
- **Data Models** - Updated Go structs to support the new field with proper JSON/DynamoDB tags
- **Documentation** - Updated design documentation and README with new field examples

### Technical Details
- Modified `VerificationRecord` and `HistoryItem` structs in `main.go`
- Updated DynamoDB table structure documentation to include new attribute
- Added proper JSON marshaling tags for the new field
- Maintains backward compatibility - existing records without reference images work normally

### Files Modified
- `main.go` - Core API implementation and data structures
- `design.md` - Updated API documentation with new field examples
- `README.md` - Updated response examples to include new field

## [1.1.0] - 2025-06-18

### üêõ Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed DynamoDB ExpressionAttributeNames validation error
  - Resolved `ValidationException: Value provided in ExpressionAttributeNames unused in expressions: keys: {#ts}`
  - Modified `buildFilterConditions()` to conditionally include attribute names only when used
  - Updated `queryVerificationRecords()` to only set `ExpressionAttributeNames` when needed
  - This fix prevents errors when filtering by `productId` or `category` without date filters

### üîß Technical Improvements
- Enhanced filter condition building logic for better DynamoDB query optimization
- Improved error handling for malformed filter expressions
- Added conditional expression attribute name management
- Optimized DynamoDB scan operations to reduce unnecessary attribute mappings

### üìù Documentation
- Added comprehensive README.md with full API documentation
- Created detailed CHANGELOG.md for version tracking
- Updated code comments for better maintainability
- Added examples for all supported query combinations

### üß™ Testing
- Verified fix with comprehensive test scenarios
- Tested all filter combinations (product, category, date, confidence)
- Validated proper DynamoDB expression generation
- Confirmed backward compatibility with existing queries
